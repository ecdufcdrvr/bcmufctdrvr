/**
 * @file spv.h
 * @brief Sparse Vector API
 *
 * This is a trimmed down sparse vector implementation tuned to the problem of
 * 24-bit FC_IDs. In this case, the 24-bit index value is broken down in three
 * 8-bit values. These values are used to index up to three 256 element arrays.
 * Arrays are allocated, only when needed. @n @n
 * The lookup can complete in constant time (3 indexed array references). @n @n
 * A typical use case would be that the fabric/directory FC_IDs would cause two rows to be
 * allocated, and the fabric assigned remote nodes would cause two rows to be allocated, with
 * the root row always allocated. This gives five rows of 256 x sizeof(void*),
 * resulting in 10k.
